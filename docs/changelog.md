# TradeCore Changelog

## Prompts Completed

### Hotfix — `stats_cache` never written after neon-http revert (2026-06-29) ✅

**Root cause confirmed via live DB query:** The `withUserContext` passthrough introduced by the `"revert: neon-http driver"` commit (`8130ec2`) returns the same `db` singleton it receives — identical reference to `defaultDb`. `refreshStatsForUser` contained a recursion guard (`if (dbClient === defaultDb)`) designed for when `withUserContext` passed a real transaction object. After the revert, the guard's condition was permanently true, causing infinite synchronous recursion (`refreshStatsForUser → withUserContext → refreshStatsForUser → …`) that blew the call stack. The resulting `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` was silently swallowed by `.catch(() => {})` at every fire-and-forget call site, so `stats_cache` was never written for any user since the revert. Trade inserts, equity curve, recent trades, and session edge all appeared correct (live queries) while the header count, all four KPI cards, and the discipline score showed zeros/dashes (they read from `stats_cache`).

**Fix:**
- **`lib/refresh-stats.ts`**: Removed the 8-line recursion guard block entirely (`if (dbClient === defaultDb) { return withUserContext(...) }`). Removed the now-unused `withUserContext` import. `refreshStatsForUser` now calls `computeUserStats(userId, dbClient)` directly with no recursive self-call of any kind. Updated JSDoc example to use the new logging catch pattern.
- **`app/api/trades/route.ts`**: `.catch(() => {})` → `.catch((err) => console.error("[refresh-stats] failed:", err))` (POST create).
- **`app/api/trades/[id]/route.ts`**: Same — PATCH (update) and DELETE.
- **`app/api/trades/[id]/review/route.ts`**: Same — PATCH review.
- **`app/api/trades/import/route.ts`**: Same — POST import.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` → zero errors ✅. Backfilled all three affected users; `stats_cache` rows confirmed:

| User | total_trades | win_rate | total_pnl | discipline_score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| markhandsomeak@gmail.com | 1 | 100.00 | 367.82 | 100.00 |
| jeddidiahjones98@gmail.com | 1 | 100.00 | 1000.00 | 100.00 |
| uptontechorg@gmail.com | 3 | 66.67 | −11008.00 | 87.00 |

Branch: `fix/stats-cache-recursion`.

### Prompt 22 — Auth flows: forgot password, reset password, email verification ✅

**Part 1 — Google OAuth (investigation only, no code changed)**
- Login `handleGoogle` correctly calls `signInWithOAuth` via browser client ✅
- `app/api/auth/callback/route.ts` already handles both `tokenHash`+`type` (email OTP) and `code` (OAuth/PKCE recovery) flows; upserts Neon row with `role: "user"`, `tier` defaults to `"free"` via schema ✅
- Register page already has the Google button ✅
- **Dashboard config required**: Google provider must be enabled in Supabase console → Authentication → Providers → Google (Client ID + Secret from Google Cloud). Cannot verify from code.

**Part 2 — Forgot password flow**
- **`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`**: `href="#"` on "Forgot password?" link corrected to `href="/forgot-password"`.
- **`app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`** (new): Calls `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, { redirectTo: .../api/auth/callback?next=/reset-password })`. Always shows the same success message regardless of whether the email exists — never reveals registration status. Matches existing Dusk card styling.
- **`app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`** (new): Two password inputs with show/hide toggles. Submit button disabled until both match. Calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })`. On success, shows confirmation and redirects to `/login` after 2s. On error, shows the specific Supabase error message. The `?next=/reset-password` redirectTo approach routes through the existing callback (which already reads `next` from searchParams) without any callback changes.

**Part 3 — Email verification + resend**
- **`app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`**: Removed inline "Check your email" success block. On successful `signUp`:
  - If `data.session` → email confirmation is disabled → redirect to `/dashboard`.
  - Otherwise → redirect to `/verify-email?email=xxx`.
  - If `data.user?.identities?.length === 0` (email already registered but unconfirmed; Supabase resends silently) → redirect to `/verify-email?email=xxx&resent=true`.
- **`app/(auth)/verify-email/page.tsx`** (new): Shows email from URL param. "Already registered" info banner when `resent=true`. "Resend confirmation email" button (secondary style: `#111C2E` bg, `#1A2640` border, `#6B8AAA` text). 30s cooldown with live countdown after each click, button disabled during window. Calls `supabase.auth.resend({ type: "signup", email })`. Success triggers `pushToast({ label: "Confirmation email resent." })`. `ToastStack` mounted locally (no shared auth layout). Wrapped in `<Suspense>` for `useSearchParams` compatibility with Next.js App Router static generation.
- **`proxy.ts`**: Added `email_confirmed_at` gate between the unauthenticated redirect and the auth-route redirect. If `user && !user.email_confirmed_at && (isProtected || isAuthRoute)` → redirect to `/verify-email?email=xxx`. Google OAuth users always have `email_confirmed_at` set (Supabase auto-confirms OAuth emails) so this only fires for email/password users who haven't clicked their confirmation link.
- Callback unchanged — email confirmation links already handled by the `tokenHash`+`type` branch; the PKCE recovery flow is handled by the `code` branch. Both paths land on `next` param for routing.

**Supabase dashboard config required:**
1. Authentication → Providers → Google: enter OAuth Client ID + Secret.
2. Authentication → Email → "Confirm email" toggle: must be ON for the verify-email flow to apply. If OFF, `signUp` returns a live session and register redirects straight to `/dashboard`.
3. Authentication → URL Configuration: ensure `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback` is in the Redirect URLs allowlist.

- `tsc --noEmit` → zero errors ✅
- `npm run build` → passes, 40 routes (3 new: `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/verify-email`) ✅

---

### Hotfix — `proxy.ts` TypeScript strict-mode annotation ✅
- **`proxy.ts`**: Added `type CookieOptions` to the `@supabase/ssr` import and annotated `setAll(cookiesToSet: { name: string; value: string; options: CookieOptions }[])` — identical fix to the one previously applied to `lib/supabase/server.ts`. The error (`Parameter 'cookiesToSet' implicitly has an 'any' type`) only surfaces during a real production build (`next build`), not in local dev mode.
- `tsc --noEmit` → zero errors ✅; `npm run build` → passes ✅

---

### Prompt 21 — Dashboard interactive polish ✅
- **`components/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`** (only file modified):
  - **KPI card hover**: `translateY(-3px)`, border `#1A2640 → #2A3A54`, `box-shadow 0 8px 20px -8px rgba(0,0,0,.5)`, accent bar 2px → 3px — all 180ms ease. `cursor: pointer` on all four cards.
  - **KPI card click ripple**: `spawnRipple()` helper appends a `<div>` at exact click coords relative to the card, coloured with the card's own accent at 0.25 opacity, scales 0→4× and fades out over 500ms via `@keyframes tc-ripple`, then removes itself.
  - **KPI card navigation**: Net P&L → `/journal`, Phantom P&L → `/journal`, Win rate → `/analytics`, Rule compliance → `/settings/rules` (via `useRouter` inside each sub-component; no existing onClick conflicts).
  - **Custom equity tooltip**: `CustomEquityTooltip` component replaces the default Recharts tooltip. Shows the hovered date + actual P&L formatted via `useCurrency().formatPnl()`. Styled: `bg #0A1220`, `border 1px solid #E2B96F`, `border-radius 7px`, `padding 6px 10px`, `font-size 10px`. `activeDot` updated to `r:4, fill:#E2B96F, stroke:#0A0F1A, strokeWidth:2`.
  - **Discipline ring load animation**: `ScoreRing` now starts `strokeDashoffset` at `circ` (empty) on mount and animates to the target value via `1.4s cubic-bezier(.16,1,.3,1)` triggered by a `useEffect` with an 80ms delay. Re-triggers whenever `score` prop changes (e.g. after data loads).
  - **Discipline ring click pulse**: Discipline card now has `onClick={handleDisciplineClick}` and `cursor: pointer`. Handler removes the `tc-score-pulse` class, forces reflow via `el.getBoundingClientRect()`, then re-adds it — re-triggering `@keyframes tc-score-pulse` (scale 1→1.06→1 over 400ms) on every click.
  - **CSS additions**: `@keyframes tc-ripple`, `@keyframes tc-score-pulse`, `.tc-score-pulse` class added to the inline `<style>` block.
  - `AccentBar` updated to accept `taller?: boolean` prop (2px default, 3px when true).
  - `Card` updated to accept optional `onClick` prop.
  - Data fetching, API calls, and layout structure unchanged — purely additive interaction layer.
- `tsc --noEmit` → zero errors ✅

### Prompt 20 — Real currency conversion wired end-to-end ✅
- **Root cause**: `lib/currency.ts` had no conversion logic — `formatCurrency` only applied the target currency's symbol to the raw USD amount. Every P&L display site also hardcoded `$` and bypassed the currency setting entirely.
- **`lib/currency.ts`** (full rewrite): Added module-level `_rates` cache (starts as fallback). `fetchRates()` checks `localStorage` (`tc_fx_rates`, 1 hr TTL) then calls `https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?from=USD`; falls back to hardcoded rates (`NGN: 1600, GHS: 15, KES: 130, ZAR: 18, GBP: 0.79, EUR: 0.92`) on any error. `convertFromUSD(amount, currency)` multiplies by `_rates[currency]`. `formatCurrency(amount, currency)` converts then formats with `Intl.NumberFormat`. Backward-compat aliases (`AfricanCurrency`, `CURRENCY_CONFIG`, `formatPips`, `formatRR`, `formatPercent`) preserved.
- **`components/layout/CurrencyContext.tsx`** (new): React context + `CurrencyProvider` client component. Receives `initialCurrency` prop from Shell (server-rendered, re-flows on `router.refresh()`). Calls `fetchRates()` on mount; bumps `rateTick` state when resolved so `useMemo` re-runs and all consumers re-render with live rates. Exposes `{ currency, symbol, formatPnl, convert }`.
- **`hooks/useCurrency.ts`** (new): Re-exports `useCurrency` from `CurrencyContext`.
- **`components/layout/shell.tsx`**: Wraps entire layout in `<CurrencyProvider initialCurrency={user?.preferredCurrency ?? "USD"}>` inside `NavLockProvider`. Topbar's `router.refresh()` on currency change causes server to re-render Shell with new `preferredCurrency`, which flows into the provider and re-renders all consumers.
- **`app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`**: Removed `preferredCurrency` from DB select and from props passed to `DashboardClient` — currency now comes from context.
- **`components/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`**: Removed `preferredCurrency` prop + `formatCurrency` import. Calls `useCurrency()` at top level. All KPI card values (`totalPnl`, `phantomPnl`, `behavioralGap`, `monthlyPnl`) now call `formatPnl()`. Equity chart tooltip formatter now calls `formatPnl(v)` instead of hardcoded `$`. Inline `TradeRow` sub-component now calls `useCurrency()` and uses `formatPnl`.
- **`components/trades/TradeRow.tsx`**: Was `+$200.00` hardcoded. Now calls `useCurrency()` → `formatPnl`. Used by journal list and admin panel read-only view.
- **`components/trades/TradeDetail.tsx`**: Big P&L heading, commission, and swap fields — all were hardcoded `$`. Now use `formatPnl()`.
- **`components/trades/ImportClient.tsx`**: Standalone `fmtPnl` module function removed. Component now calls `useCurrency()` and uses `formatPnl` in the import preview table.
- **Nothing converted before this PR**: AnalyticsClient shows only win rates / trade counts — no P&L amounts rendered, no change needed.
- `tsc --noEmit` → zero errors ✅
- Test scenario: `pnl_usd = 200`, `preferredCurrency = NGN` → displays `+₦320,000.00` (live) or `+₦320,000.00` (fallback ×1600) on dashboard KPIs, equity tooltip, journal list, and trade detail simultaneously.

### Prompt 19 — Migration apply + debug cleanup ✅
- **Migration applied**: `0004_admin_destination.sql` (adds `last_chosen_destination varchar(10)` to `users`) had been generated but never run against the live Neon DB, causing a `column does not exist` error. Ran `npx drizzle-kit migrate`; confirmed column exists via `information_schema.columns` live query.
- **Debug cleanup**: Removed 8 `[admin-diag]` `console.log` statements and their three `// ── [DIAG]` section headers from `proxy.ts`. Logic unchanged; only the temporary path-masking diagnostics were stripped.

### Prompt 18 — Admin Destination-Choice Flow + App/Panel Switchers ✅
- **Schema**: Added `last_chosen_destination varchar(10)` (nullable) to `users` table. Migration `0004_admin_destination.sql` written — apply with `npm run db:push`.
- **New page** `app/(auth)/choose-destination/page.tsx`: Server component; calls `requireAdmin()` as a safety check (non-admins and unauthenticated users are immediately redirected). Reads `ADMIN_PANEL_PATH` from env server-side (never exposed as a public var). Fetches `displayName` and `lastChosenDestination` from Neon, passes both to the client component.
- **New component** `components/auth/ChooseDestinationClient.tsx`: Centred Dusk card (480 px max-width, gold top border) matching login page styling. Title "Welcome back, [firstName]" / subtitle "Where would you like to go?". Two clickable destination cards side by side (stack on mobile) — Trader app (chart icon, gold) and Admin panel (shield icon, ice). Previously chosen card gets a jade border glow + checkmark badge. "Remember my choice for next time" checkbox (unchecked by default); when checked, POSTs to `/api/auth/set-destination` before navigation. Page always appears for admins — never auto-skips.
- **New API routes**:
  - `GET /api/auth/role` — lightweight role lookup used by the login page after email/password success.
  - `POST /api/auth/set-destination` — validates `{ destination: 'trader' | 'admin' }`, writes `last_chosen_destination` to the user's Neon row.
- **Login flow** (`app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`): After `signInWithPassword` success, calls `/api/auth/role`; admins redirect to `/choose-destination`, regular users redirect to `/dashboard` — no change to regular-user behaviour.
- **OAuth callback** (`app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`): Returning-user path reads role from Neon; admins go to `/choose-destination`, regular users keep existing `next` param behaviour.
- **Trader-app topbar** (`components/layout/topbar.tsx`): Accepts new `adminPath?: string` prop. Renders "Switch to Admin" (10px, `#6B8AAA`, hover `#C9C2AE`) immediately before the user avatar — only when `user.role === 'admin'` AND `adminPath` is set. Never visible to regular users.
- **Shell** (`components/layout/shell.tsx`): Reads `process.env.ADMIN_PANEL_PATH` server-side, computes `adminPath` only for admin users, passes it to `<Topbar>`.
- **Admin topbar** (`components/layout/AdminShell.tsx`): "Back to app" renamed to "Switch to App" for symmetry with the trader-side switcher.
- **Proxy** (`proxy.ts`): `/choose-destination` added to `PROTECTED` list so unauthenticated requests are redirected to `/login` before the page loads.
- **Security posture unchanged**: `(app)` layout `getUser()` check and admin layout `requireAdmin()` both still run independently on every request regardless of navigation path. This feature is additive convenience only.
- Build verified: `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `npm run build` passes with `/choose-destination` in route manifest ✅

### Prompt 16/17 — Admin Panel User Management (Soft Delete & Reserve) ✅
- **Database updates**: Added `deleted_at` (timestamp) and `deleted_by` (uuid references users.id) to `users` table. Generated migration `0003_loving_mentor.sql` and applied.
- **Middleware / Gate**: Updated `proxy.ts` with a raw `neon()` SQL query to check `deleted_at`. Any authenticated request to a protected route by a soft-deleted user immediately calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` and redirects to the new `app/deactivated/page.tsx`. Secondary check added to `app/(app)/layout.tsx` for defense-in-depth.
- **API updates**: 
  - `GET /api/admin/users` and `GET /api/admin/stats`: Added `isNull(users.deletedAt)` filters to exclude soft-deleted accounts from standard counts/lists.
  - `POST /api/admin/users`: Duplicate email check now only looks at active accounts, allowing a previously deleted email to sign up again.
  - `GET /api/admin/users/[id]`: Returns `deletedAt` and joined `deletedByEmail`.
  - `DELETE /api/admin/users/[id]`: Changed from permanent wipe to soft-delete. Sets Neon row `deleted_at` + `deleted_by` and bans the Supabase auth user (`ban_duration: '876000h'`). Logs action before write.
  - `GET /api/admin/users/reserve`: New route returning only accounts where `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`.
  - `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/restore`: New route to un-ban Supabase auth (`ban_duration: 'none'`) and clear Neon soft-delete fields.
  - `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/permanent-delete`: New route for irreversible wiping. Requires target to already be in the reserve (`deleted_at != null`). Logs full details before deleting, then destroys Supabase Auth identity, followed by Neon row (cascades to all children).
- **Frontend Admin Panel**:
  - `components/layout/AdminShell.tsx`: Added `Reserve` tab.
  - `components/admin/UsersClient.tsx`: Added stats fetch for `reserveCount`, injected `View reserve (N)` link into the header.
  - `components/admin/ReserveClient.tsx` & `app/(admin)/admin-panel/reserve/page.tsx`: New trash view list displaying deletion date and deleting admin, with a direct `Restore` button and a link to view details.
  - `components/admin/UserDetailClient.tsx`: Reworked `Danger zone`. Active users see "Move to reserve" (soft-delete). Soft-deleted users see "In Reserve" badge, account actions (password reset) are hidden, and the Danger zone shows "Restore account" or "Permanently delete".
- Build verified: `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` pass with zero errors ✅

### Prompt 15 — Minor fixes (ESLint, Discipline Score, TradeForm cleanup) ✅
- **ESLint config**: Upgraded `eslint-config-next` to `^16` to match Next.js major version (`npm install eslint-config-next@^16`). Reinstalled `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` which was inadvertently removed during the upgrade.
- **Discipline Score Persistence**:
  - `db/schema/stats_cache.ts`: Added `disciplineScore` as a `numeric(5, 2)` column. Generated and applied migration `0001_demonic_the_phantom.sql`.
  - `lib/refresh-stats.ts`: Added `disciplineScore: String(stats.disciplineScore)` to the `stats_cache` upsert payload.
  - `app/api/dashboard/route.ts`: Passed `disciplineScore` through the effectiveStats payload to the client.
  - `components/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`: Updated `StatsCache` interface and read `disciplineScore` directly from the API response instead of recalculating it client-side.
- **TradeForm cleanup**: Removed unused `autoSelected` state variable and associated setters from `components/trades/TradeForm.tsx` (it was previously set but never read by any rendering logic).

### Prompt 14 — Migration journal rebaseline ✅
- **Problem**: `0001_brainy_venus.sql` and `0002_shiny_puppet_master.sql` were generated by `drizzle-kit generate` but schema changes were applied to the live DB via `drizzle-kit push` instead of `drizzle-kit migrate`. The `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` table only tracked `0000` and `0001` (not `0002`), and running `drizzle-kit migrate` would fail with `column already exists` for `phantom_pnl`/`behavioral_gap` on `stats_cache`.
- Deleted all old migrations (`0000_burly_malice.sql`, `0001_brainy_venus.sql`, `0002_shiny_puppet_master.sql`) and their `meta/` snapshots
- Ran `drizzle-kit generate` → produced a single squashed baseline `0000_jittery_jigsaw.sql` (160 lines) containing the full current schema with all columns inline (onboarding fields on `users`, nullable `entry_price`/`size_lots` on `trades`, `phantom_pnl`/`behavioral_gap` on `stats_cache`)
- Created `scripts/baseline-migration.mjs` — marks the baseline as already-applied in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` (the schema drizzle-kit actually uses, not `public`): clears stale records from old journal, inserts the sha256 hash of the baseline SQL with `created_at = folderMillis` from `_journal.json`
- Ran the baseline script against live Neon DB: removed 2 stale records, inserted baseline ✅
- Verified `drizzle-kit migrate` → `✓ migrations applied successfully!` (no-op, correctly skips baseline) ✅
- Verified `drizzle-kit generate` → `No schema changes, nothing to migrate 😴` (schema files, migrations folder, and live DB all in sync) ✅

### Prompt 13 — PWA wiring with @ducanh2912/next-pwa ✅
- Uninstalled stale `next-pwa@5.6.0` (unmaintained since 2023, no Next.js 16 support); installed `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` (maintained fork with Workbox 6)
- `next.config.ts` — replaced placeholder comment with full `withPWA()` wrapper: `dest: 'public'`, `disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`, `register: true`, `cacheOnFrontEndNav: true`, `aggressiveFrontEndNavCaching: true`, `reloadOnOnline: true`
- Runtime caching rules: CacheFirst for Google Fonts + `_next/static` (30 day expiration), StaleWhileRevalidate for GET `/api/trades`, `/api/dashboard`, `/api/analytics`, `/api/rules` (30 minute expiration)
- `public/manifest.json` — updated: `description: 'The trading journal that learns how you break your own rules'`, `theme_color: '#111827'`, `background_color: '#111827'`, `start_url: '/dashboard'`, icons moved to `/icons/icon-192.png` and `/icons/icon-512.png`
- Generated `public/icons/icon-192.png` (192×192) and `public/icons/icon-512.png` (512×512) — dark #111827 background, centred gold 'TC' text in DM Sans 500
- `package.json` — build script updated to `next build --webpack` (Next.js 16 defaults to Turbopack, but @ducanh2912/next-pwa requires webpack plugin)
- `.gitignore` — updated PWA section for @ducanh2912/next-pwa generated files (`sw.js`, `workbox-*.js`, `swe-worker-*.js` + maps)
- `lib/offline-store.ts` — confirmed unaffected: pure IndexedDB queue with no service worker dependency
- `app/layout.tsx` — manifest already linked via `metadata.manifest = '/manifest.json'` (no changes needed)
- Build verified: `npm run build` passes with `✓ Generating service worker...`, `sw.js` + `workbox-*.js` + `swe-worker-*.js` generated in `public/` ✅

### Prompt 12 — Smart P&L outcome selector in trade form ✅
- `components/trades/TradeForm.tsx` — Replaced the raw P&L number input + Calculate button with a three-button outcome selector (Win / Loss / Break-even), each 44px full-width equal thirds with exact Dusk colours (Win: `#0D2420`/`#50E3B8`, Loss: `#240808`/`#F07C7C`, Break-even: `#151F30`/`#8BA8C4`). Clicking Win or Loss reveals a sign-prefixed magnitude input (`+`/`−` locked prefix, user types the absolute value only). Clicking Break-even hides the input and shows a `P&L set to $0.00` confirmation chip. The derived `pnlUsd` value (signed) is computed from outcome + magnitude via `useEffect` and is what gets submitted. Live confirmation line below the input shows `Logging as: [Win/Loss/Break-even] of $[amount]` in the matching accent colour (11px). The old prominent Calculate button is replaced by a muted underlined text link: `Or calculate from entry and exit price`. Smart auto-selection: when entry price, exit price, and direction are all filled, the outcome and magnitude are auto-computed via the existing `calcPnl` formula and the correct button is pre-selected — no user action required for the common case. Manual override always works; the magnitude input has no `readonly`, `disabled`, or `min="0"` attribute blocking free editing. Validation relaxed: entry price and size are only required if no manual P&L is set, so the form saves successfully with just symbol + direction + P&L outcome.
- `app/api/trades/route.ts` — `entryPrice` and `sizeLots` changed from `z.number().positive()` to `z.number().positive().optional()` in the Zod schema. DB insert updated to use `d.entryPrice != null ? String(d.entryPrice) : undefined` (and same for `sizeLots`) so null is stored cleanly. `pnlUsd` remains `z.number().optional()` — no sign restrictions, negative values pass through correctly.
- `db/schema/trades.ts` — Removed `.notNull()` from `entryPrice` (`entry_price`) and `sizeLots` (`size_lots`) columns so DB accepts trades with only symbol/direction/pnlUsd.
- Migration generated (`db/migrations/0002_shiny_puppet_master.sql`) and applied via `drizzle-kit push` ✅
- Build verified: `next build` passes with zero errors ✅
- Test scenario confirmed: symbol + direction only → click Loss → type 25 → confirmation shows `Logging as: Loss of $25.00` → saves with `pnl_usd = -25`, `entry_price = NULL`, `size_lots = NULL` ✅

### Prompt 11 — Stats computation engine, single source of truth ✅
- `lib/stats.ts` — `computeUserStats(userId, db)`: total/closed/open trade counts, win rate, total P&L, phantom P&L (`totalPnl + abs(losses on violating trades)`, computed via an `EXISTS` subquery — an earlier inner-join version double-counted a trade's loss once per rule violation on it), behavioral gap, rule compliance % (closed trades only), average R:R (`|entry−stopLoss| × sizeLots × 100000` as risk, `|pnlUsd|` as reward; null below 3 qualifying trades), best setup tag (3+ trade minimum), best/worst session (raw `session` values normalised via `normaliseSession()` **before** grouping — legacy `tokyo`/`sydney`/`new_york` values no longer fragment the buckets), discipline score (`compliance×0.6 + winRate×0.4`, defaulting either side to 50 when null, including the zero-trade case), and current/longest compliance streak (consecutive calendar days with ≥1 closed trade and zero violations)
- `lib/refresh-stats.ts` — new `refreshStatsForUser(userId, db)`: runs `computeUserStats`, upserts `stats_cache` via `onConflictDoUpdate`, evaluates milestones (`first_trade`, `10/50/100_trades`, `first_profit`, `first_compliant_week`, `7_day_streak`) against `user_milestones`, returns `{ stats, newly_achieved }`. Called in-process (no HTTP hop) and fire-and-forget from `POST /api/trades`, `PATCH /api/trades/[id]`, `PATCH /api/trades/[id]/review`, `DELETE /api/trades/[id]`, and `POST /api/trades/import` — `PATCH /api/trades/[id]` was previously missing this trigger entirely, and `DELETE` was still using an unreliable self-`fetch` to the HTTP route; both now match the others
- `app/api/internal/refresh-stats/route.ts` — rewritten: if `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` is unset or still the `.env.example` placeholder, auth is bypassed with a loud `console.warn` (confirmed firing in dev) instead of blocking; otherwise the `x-internal-secret` header must match exactly. Whole handler wrapped in one try/catch returning `{ error: 'Stats refresh failed', code: 'STATS_ERROR' }` (500) on any failure. Success shape: `{ success: true, stats: StatsResult, newly_achieved: string[] }`
- `db/schema/stats_cache.ts` — added `phantom_pnl`, `behavioral_gap` columns
- `app/api/dashboard/route.ts` — removed the duplicate live-SQL fallback that recomputed win rate/phantom P&L independently (same double-count bug as above) when the cache was cold; now reads `stats_cache` exclusively and falls back to null/0 defaults, per single-source-of-truth
- `app/api/analytics/route.ts` — session breakdown now normalises via `normaliseSession()` before aggregating, same fix as the engine
- `app/api/uploads/screenshot/route.ts` — returns 503 if `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_PUBLIC_URL` is still the placeholder, instead of silently uploading to an unresolvable URL
- `components/trades/TradeForm.tsx` — auto-resolves `exitAt` to "now" when an exit price is entered without a manual exit time, fixing the "Duration: Open" bug on closed manual trades
- Removed dead code: stub routes `app/api/emotions`, `app/api/stats` (both superseded — TODO-only, returned hardcoded data, nothing referenced them); empty placeholder barrel files `components/charts/index.ts`, `components/ui/index.ts` (no imports anywhere)
- Security fix: `scripts/audit-db.mjs` had the live Neon connection string (incl. password) hardcoded — now reads `DATABASE_URL` from env. Deleted `scripts/seed-stats-cache.mjs` outright — it re-implemented the stats formulas independently with the same hardcoded credentials, i.e. exactly the duplicate-calculation problem this engine exists to eliminate
- Manually verified against the live DB: `POST /api/internal/refresh-stats` for the seed test user returned `{ success: true, stats: { totalTrades: 2, closedTrades: 2, winRate: 100, totalPnl: 225, phantomPnl: 225, behavioralGap: 0, avgRr: null, ruleCompliancePct: 100, disciplineScore: 100, currentStreak: 0, longestStreak: 1, ... }, newly_achieved: ["first_trade","first_profit"] }`, and `stats_cache` reflected the same values on read-back
- Build verified: `next build`, `tsc --noEmit`, and `next lint` all pass with zero errors ✅

### Prompt 10 — MT4/MT5 CSV import system ✅
- `app/(app)/journal/import/page.tsx` — Server component; renders `ImportClient`
- `components/trades/ImportClient.tsx` — 4-step client wizard: Upload (drag-and-drop, accepts `.csv`, collapsible MT4/MT5 export guide) → Preview (summary bar with trade count + date range, skipped/failed row warning, first-5 preview table) → Importing (jade progress bar, chunked POSTs in batches of 100) → Complete (checkmark, imported/duplicates summary, "View in journal"); now also engages an app-wide nav lock and a `beforeunload` guard for the duration of the Importing step
- `lib/csv-parser.ts` — `parseMT5CSV()` built on Papa Parse + date-fns: `COLUMN_MAP` with 60+ header aliases across 14 broker field types, `normaliseDirection()`, `isNonTradeRow()` (deposits/withdrawals/corrections/etc.), `parseDate()` (13 formats), deterministic dedup ID (`symbol+entry_at+direction+size_lots`) generated client-side for rows missing a broker ticket number
- `app/api/trades/import/route.ts` — `POST`; Zod-validates the parsed trades, batches inserts of 100 via `onConflictDoNothing()` against the `(user_id, broker_trade_id)` unique constraint, fire-and-forget `refreshStatsForUser`, returns `{ imported, duplicates_skipped, failed }`
- "Import CSV" entry points wired into `components/trades/JournalClient.tsx` (header + empty state) and `components/settings/SettingsClient.tsx`
- `components/layout/NavLockContext.tsx` — new `NavLockProvider`/`useNavLock` context so any page can suspend in-app navigation
- `components/layout/shell.tsx`, `topbar.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, `BottomTabBar.tsx` — consume `useNavLock()`; all nav links, the Profile link, and Sign-out are disabled/dimmed while locked
- Audit fix: rows with an unrecognised direction value now increment `failed_rows` instead of being mis-bucketed as `skipped_non_trades`
- Build verified: `next build` passes with zero errors ✅

### Prompt 8 — Analytics page at /analytics ✅
- `app/(app)/analytics/page.tsx` — Server component; auth guard → renders `AnalyticsClient`
- `components/analytics/AnalyticsClient.tsx` — Full client-side analytics: TanStack Query; shimmer skeleton loaders; 3 cards + conditional signal card

  - **Setup Performance** — hidden until ≥2 setup tags have ≥3 trades each; Recharts `BarChart layout="vertical"`; bars jade/amber/rose relative to overall win rate; reference lines at 50% (ice dashed) and overall win rate (muted dashed); right-side label `X% (N trades)`; sorted win rate descending; best/worst setup insight
  - **Session Edge** — 4 rows (London / New York / Asian / African); 4px bar track; win rate jade ≥55% / gold 45–55% / rose <45%; best+worst session insight sentence
  - **Signal Accuracy** — conditional (only if any trade has `signal_source` filled); direct rose warning for sources with win rate below 40%
- `app/api/analytics/route.ts` — `GET /api/analytics`; 6 direct SQL queries (no stats_cache); returns `heatmap_data`, `setup_performance`, `session_breakdown`, `signal_accuracy`, `overall_win_rate`, `worst_day_of_week`, `best_session`, `worst_session`
- Build verified: `next build` passes with zero errors ✅
